# Convyer_Belt_System


Project Objective :  
   
    the project objective is to design and manufacture Convyer belt to link between two Moveo Robots.

    August 2021 ; during my internship period in MRS research Lab -Multi Robot Systems- in german university in cairo.
    
Project Description :
    
    First the convyer belt is designed and modeled on Solidworks and then the designed parts is manufactured using CNC Router , conventional Lathe and Milling machine -for the rollers and tensioner blocks- , and last but not least a software is designed to sense if there is something is on the convyer and move the belt to the other side and stop the belt if the object is arrived to the location where the other robot can hold it.
